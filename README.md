## Overview

`42-local` is a utility designed to help manage the local environment, likely tailored for students at 42 schools. This initial alpha version focuses primarily on **cleaning** unnecessary files to free up storage space. Future versions may include installation assistance or other features.

## Features (Alpha v0.1.0)

*   **ðŸ§¹ Local Cache Cleaning:** Identifies and removes common cache files and temporary data specific to the 42 environment (or general development).
*   **ðŸ’¡ Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use interface (details depend on implementation - web-based, script, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   _(Add any prerequisites here, e.g., Node.js, a specific browser, etc.)_

## Motivation

Managing local storage space can be challenging, especially in environments with quotas like 42 schools. This tool aims to simplify the process of cleaning up unnecessary files.

## Roadmap

*   **Alpha:** Basic cleaning functionality.
*   **Beta:** Add configuration options, potentially support for more types of files/caches.
*   **v1.0:** Stable release, possibly including the "install" features mentioned in the original description.
