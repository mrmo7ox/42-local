## Overview

`42-local` is a utility designed to help manage the local environment, likely tailored for students at 42 schools. This initial alpha version focuses primarily on **cleaning** unnecessary files to free up storage space. Future versions may include installation assistance or other features.

## Features (Alpha v0.1.0)

*   **ðŸ§¹ Local Cache Cleaning:** Identifies and removes common cache files and temporary data specific to the 42 environment (or general development).
*   **ðŸ’¡ Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use interface (details depend on implementation - web-based, script, etc.).

Managing local storage space can be challenging, especially in environments with quotas like 42 schools. This tool aims to simplify the process of cleaning up unnecessary files.

## Roadmap
